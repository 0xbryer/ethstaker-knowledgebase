For operators running hundreds of Ethereum validators, maintaining high uptime is not just a goal; it's a necessity. In this context, understanding and effectively managing failover and synchronization mechanisms are crucial. This page delves into the specifics of failover in the beacon node context and introduces WebSocket (WS) sync, a concept quite distinct from traditional Proof of Work (PoW) synchronization methods, along with its trust assumptions.

### **Beacon Node Failover**

*   **What is Failover?**

    Failover is a resilience strategy employed to ensure the continuous operation of the beacon nodes. In the event of a failure or downtime in the primary node, failover mechanisms automatically switch operations to a standby node to maintain uninterrupted service. Beacon nodes are pivotal in maintaining the network's consensus by aggregating and disseminating information about validators. Their uninterrupted operation is crucial for the consistent performance of validators.
* **Implementing Failover**:
  * **Infrastructure Setup**: This involves setting up secondary nodes that are always in sync with the primary node, ready to take over instantly in case of a failure.
  * **Automated Monitoring and Switching**: Implement systems that continuously monitor the health of the primary beacon node and automate the switching process to the standby node in case of detected anomalies.
  * **Regular Testing**: Regularly test failover mechanisms to ensure they work seamlessly when needed. This includes simulating failures and monitoring the switch-over process.
