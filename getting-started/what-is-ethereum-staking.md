# O que é staking de Ethereum?

Staking é o ato de depositar 32 ETH para ativar o software validador. Como validador, você será responsável por armazenar dados, processar transações e adicionar novos blocos a blockchain. Isso manterá a rede Ethereum seguro para todos e você ganhará novos ETH nesse processo.

## 💰Ganhe recompensas

As recompensas são dadas por ações que ajudam a rede a chegar a um consenso. Você receberá recompensas por executar o software que agrupa corretamente as transações em novos blocos e verifica o trabalho de outros validadores, uma vez que isso mantém a cadeia funcionando de forma segura.

## 🔒 Mais segurança

A rede fica mais forte contra ataques à medida que mais ETH é stakeado, pois é necessário cada vez mais ETH para controlar a maioria da rede. Para se tornar uma ameaça, você precisaria ter a maioria dos validadores, o que significa que você precisaria controlar a maioria do ETH disponível no sistema - o que é muito ETH!

## 🌿 Mais sustentável

Os stakers não precisam de computadores com uso intensivo de energia para participar de um sistema de Prova de Participação (PoS) - apenas um computador doméstico ou (no futuro) um smartphone. Isso transforma o Ethereum em um produto melhor para o meio ambiente.

## Como stakear seu ETH

### 🏡 Solo home staking

* Most impactful
* Full control
* Full rewards
* Trustless

Solo staking on Ethereum is the **gold standard** for staking. It provides full participation rewards, improves the decentralization of the network, and never requires trusting anyone else with your funds.

Those considering solo staking should have at least 32 ETH and a dedicated computer connected to the internet \~24/7. Some technical know-how is helpful, but easy-to-use tools now exist to help simplify this process.

### ☁️ Staking as a service

* Your 32 ETH
* Your validator keys
* Entrusted node operation

If you don't want or don't feel comfortable dealing with hardware but still want to stake your 32 ETH, staking-as-a-service options allow you to delegate the hard part while you earn native block rewards.

These options usually walk you through creating a set of validator credentials, uploading your signing keys to them, and depositing your 32 ETH. This allows the service to validate on your behalf.

This method of staking requires a certain level of trust in the provider. To limit counter-party risk, the keys to withdrawal your ETH are usually kept in your possession.

### 🪺 Pooled staking

* Stake any amount
* Earn rewards
* Keep it simple
* Popular

Several pooling solutions now exist to assist users who do not have or feel comfortable staking 32 ETH.

Many of these options include what is known as 'liquid staking' which involves an ERC-20 liquidity token that represents your staked ETH.

Liquid staking enables easy and anytime exiting and makes staking as simple as a token swap. This option also allows users to hold custody of their assets in their own Ethereum wallet.

Pooled staking is not native to the Ethereum network. Third parties are building these solutions, and they carry their own risks.

### 🏢 Centralized exchanges

* Least impactful
* Highest trust assumptions

Many centralized exchanges provide staking services if you are not yet comfortable holding ETH in your own wallet. They can be a fallback to allow you to earn some yield on your ETH holdings with minimal oversight or effort.

The trade-off here is that centralized providers consolidate large pools of ETH to run large numbers of validators. This can be dangerous for the network and its users as it creates a large centralized target and point of failure, making the network more vulnerable to attack or bugs.

If you don't feel comfortable holding your own keys, that's okay. These options are here for you. In the meantime, consider checking out the [ethereum.org wallets page](https://ethereum.org/wallets/), where you can get started learning how to take true ownership over your funds. When you're ready, come back and level up your staking game by trying one of the self-custody pooled staking services offered.

***

As you may have noticed, there are many ways to participate in Ethereum staking. These paths target a wide range of users and ultimately are each unique and vary in terms of risks, rewards, and trust assumptions. Some are more decentralized, battle-tested and/or risky than others. We provide some information on popular projects in the space, but always do your own research before sending ETH anywhere.
